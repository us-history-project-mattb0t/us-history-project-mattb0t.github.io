          Japan invades Manchuria
        </p>
        <p class='dateText'>
          September 18, 1931
        </p>
        <p class='infoText'>

          Japan invades Manchuria over the Mukden Incident, where Japanese soldiers
          dressed like the Chinese and attacked their own train station near Mukden.
          Following this fabrication, the Japanese government declares war upon
          Chinese government (the Kuomintang, headed by Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shek).

          <br><br>

          The Japanese fabricated the Mukden incident in order to obtain the valuable
          natural resources in Manchuria that they desperately needed. The Japanese,
          once they controlled Manchuria, created a puppet government called Manchukuo.
          It is the start of the Japanese, imperialist invasion of China.

          Nazi Germany Annexes Austria
        </p>
        <p class='dateText'>
          March 12, 1938
        </p>
        <p class='infoText'>

          The Austrian people have "agreed" to unite with Hitler's Nazi Germany to form a "greater Germany;"
          Nazi troops occupied Austria, installed a German government, and promptly held a referedum
          which claimed that 99.7561% of the votes cast supported the new government. Austrian Jews were
          excluded from this vote.

          <br><br>

          This union of Germany-Austria was prohibited by the Treaty of Versailles; however, the only
          action that was taken against Nazi Germany was verbal. The Allies are still unwilling to
          end Hitler's aggressive expansion in Europe.

          Hitler and Stalin invade Poland
        </p>
        <p class='dateText'>
          September 1, 1939
        </p>
        <p class='infoText'>

          Hitler's Nazi Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union begin their joint invasion of Poland.
          The Allies are sending very limited aid to the defense of Poland. Most Poles have lost
          hope, and are ordering a mass evacuation of soldiers to Romania.

          <br><br>

          Poland will be divided into two regions upon capitulation: one that will be occupied by Nazi Germany, and the other that will be occupied
          by the Soviet Union. Before the invasion, the two nations signed a treaty: the Molotov-Ribbentrop
          Pact. This treaty was a pact of non-aggression, meaning that they promised not to attack each other
          and invade Poland together.

        Confessions from a Nazi

      <p class='dateText'>
        June 7, 1960

        KELLEY: With the second, largest war in the history of the entire world at its conclusion,
        we have but only ask why the aggressors why they have committed the atrocities they have
        perpetrated. I'm Jack Kelley, here with an interview with Adolf Eichmann. Let's start with a
        simple question, Mr. Eichmann: why do you believe the Jews are inferior?

        <br><br>

        EICHMANN: Why, there is every reason to believe that they are inferior. They come in to our
        country when it is weak and they prey on German businesses with their wealth and greed. I
        hate them, but I do not approve of their annihilation.

        <br><br>

        KELLEY: What part did you play in the Holocaust?

        <br><br>

        EICHMANN: I organised the transportation logistics between Polish ghettoes and the camps.
        I was even Heydrich's "special expert" as it were. I managed where the belongings of the
        captured Jews went, coordinated with the secret police (the Gestapo,) and financed it all.

        <br><br>

        KELLEY: Final question, do you feel any guilt for what you have done?

        <br><br>

        EICHMANN: Guilt? No. I was merely following orders. The decision was to be made by my superiors:
        MÃ¼ller, Heydrich, Himmler, and ultimately Hitler. I feel absolved of all guilt. The matter was
        out of my hands, as it were. What was I to do? To defy Hitler himself? That would be death.

        <br><br>

        KELLEY: Well, you heard it from Mr. Eichmann yourself, fellow Americans. This is the scum we were
        fighting against. Your trial for your war crimes will be rather soon, Mr. Eichmann. This concludes
        our interview.
