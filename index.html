          Japan invades Manchuria
        </p>
        <p class='dateText'>
          September 18, 1931

          Japan invades Manchuria over the Mukden Incident, where Japanese soldiers
          dressed like the Chinese and attacked their own train station near Mukden.
          Following this fabrication, the Japanese government declares war upon
          Chinese government (the Kuomintang, headed by Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shek).

          <br><br>

          The Japanese fabricated the Mukden incident in order to obtain the valuable
          natural resources in Manchuria that they desperately needed. The Japanese,
          once they controlled Manchuria, created a puppet government called Manchukuo.

          Nazi Germany Annexes Austria
        </p>

          The Austrian people have "agreed" to unite with Hitler's Nazi Germany to form a "greater Germany;"
          Nazi troops occupied Austria, installed a German government, and promptly held a referedum
          which claimed that 99.7561% of the votes cast supported the new government. Austrian Jews were
          excluded from this vote.

          <br><br>

          This union of Germany-Austria was prohibited by the Treaty of Versailles; however, the only
          action that was taken against Nazi Germany was verbal. The Allies are still unwilling to
          end Hitler's aggressive expansion in Europe.

          Hitler and Stalin invade Poland
        </p>
        <p class='dateText'>
          September 1, 1939
        </p>
        <p class='infoText'>

          Hitler's Nazi Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union begin their joint invasion of Poland.
          The Allies are sending very limited aid to the defense of Poland. Most Poles have lost
          hope, and are ordering a mass evacuation of soldiers to Romania.

          <br><br>

          Poland is going to be divided into two regions: one that will be occupied by Nazi Germany, and the other that will be occupied
          by the Soviet Union. Before the invasion, the two nations signed a treaty: the Molotov-Ribbentrop
          Pact. This treaty was a pact of non-aggression, meaning that they promised not to attack each other
          and invade Poland together.
